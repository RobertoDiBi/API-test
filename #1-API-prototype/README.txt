--Building a RESTful API in Node and Express--

The API implements 2 simple calls:

http://localhost/api/ratingaverage/1
http://localhost/api/reviews/1

It also has a post method for both call but it doesn't actually post anything since there is no database behind and the two GET call are hardcoded. It Just returns a message informing that you made a post.

--Requirements--
Node


Clone the repo: git clone 
Start the server: npm start
